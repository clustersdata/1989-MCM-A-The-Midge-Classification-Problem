# 1989-MCM-A-The-Midge-Classification-Problem


Two species of midges, Af and Apf, have been identified by biologists Grogan and Wirth on the basis of antenna and wing length (see Figure 1). It is important to be able to classify a specimen as Af of Apf, given the antenna and wing length.

    Given a midge that you know is species Af or Apf, how would you go about classifying it?
    Apply your method to three specimens with (antenna, wing) lengths (1.24,1.80),(1.28,1.84),(1.40,2.04).
    Assume that the species is a valuable pollinator and species Apf is a carrier of a debilitating disease. Would you modify your classification scheme and if so, how?
